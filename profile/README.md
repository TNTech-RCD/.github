# :wave: Hey there, we're Tennessee Tech University's Research Computing and Data division.

We (currently [@mikerenfro](https://github.com/mikerenfro/), [@SColson82](https://github.com/SColson82/), and [@Goose7888](https://github.com/Goose7888/)) pretty much cover all aspects of support for compute-intensive research and coursework across the university.

We manage the on-campus HPC environment, facilitate use of federally-funded resources including those in the NSF ACCESS program, and do a lot of training and consulting.

Contact us at [www.rcd.tntech.edu/contact/](https://www.rcd.tntech.edu/contact) for more information.
